## 📝 Problem Statement

A monkey is given n piles of bananas, where the 'ith' pile has nums[i] bananas. An integer h represents the total time in hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats k bananas. If the pile contains fewer than k bananas, the monkey eats all the bananas in that pile and does not consume any more bananas in that hour.

Determine the **minimum** number of bananas the monkey must eat per hour to finish all the bananas within h hours.

### Example 1:

Input: n = 4, nums = [7, 15, 6, 3], h = 8

Output: 5

Explanation: If Koko eats 5 bananas/hr, he will take 2, 3, 2, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 8 hours to complete all the piles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 2:

Input: n = 5, nums = [25, 12, 8, 14, 19], h = 5

Output: 25

Explanation: If Koko eats 25 bananas/hr, he will take 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 5 hours to complete all the piles.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- &nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= n <= 10^4
- &nbsp;&nbsp;n <= h <= 10^9
- &nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
